            <h3>AIcademy</h3>

            <p>
                AIcademy is an adaptive learning platform designed to support elementary school students during a critical stage of literacy and skill development. 
                Since COVID-19, literacy rates and academic performance among young learners have declined, raising concerns about long-term educational gaps. 
                AIcademy was created to address this challenge by making learning more engaging, personalized, and accessible.
            </p>

            <p>
                The platform uses AI-driven personalization to adapt lessons to each student’s learning pace and skill level. 
                By combining interactive content with familiar, character-driven experiences inspired by Disney-style storytelling, 
                AIcademy transforms traditional learning into an engaging, quest-based experience.
            </p>

            <p>
                Students progress through educational “quests,” earn rewards, and strengthen foundational skills in reading and comprehension through 
                interactive exercises. The goal is to motivate consistent learning while reducing frustration and disengagement often associated with early education tools.
            </p>

            <p>
                This project demonstrates my ability to identify a real-world problem, design a user-centered solution, and think through both the 
                educational and engagement aspects of a digital product. It also reflects my interest in building technology that is meaningful, human-centered, 
                and impactful.
