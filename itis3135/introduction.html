        <p> Hi, my name is Zainab. I'm a first-year student, but technically a junior because I went to middle college. I am majoring in Computer Science with a concentration in Human Computer Interaction. In my free time I like to hang out with friends, bake, and go to cafes.
 </p>
        <p><strong>Personal Background:</strong> My family is originally from Pakistan. I was born in Virginia and my family moved to Charlotte when I was just a couple of months old and I’ve been living here ever since. </p>
        <p><strong>Professional Background</strong>I have done one internship in high school through a program run by the city of Charlotte where I got to intern at Accenture. It was really fun and sparked my interest in UX Design. For the past year now, I've been working part-time at Kumon.</p>
        <p><strong>Academic Background:</strong> I just graduated high school with my Associates degree this past May. I am a Junior, Computer Science Major.</p>
        <p><strong>Primary Computer: </strong>Apple, Sonoma 14.7.7 13-inch 2019 Macbook Air, I primarily work from home or on campus.</p>
        <p><strong>Courses I’m Taking, & Why:</strong>
        <br><br>
        <strong>ITSC3688</strong> - Computers and Their Impact on Society: Required course for my major, and to strengthen public speaking skills
        <br><br>
        <strong>ITSC1600</strong>- Computing Professionals: Required part of my degree
        <br><br>
        <strong>ITIS3130</strong>- Intro to Human Centered Computing: To gain further understanding in HCI and is part of my concentration
        <br><br>
        <strong>ITIS4353</strong> - Social Technology Design: I chose this class from the options I had for my concentration because it discusses the social aspect of computing and how interaction works on social interfaces and I found that to be very interesting.
