    <h2>About Us</h2>
    <p>Dozephin started with a simple idea: combine the calming power of ocean sounds with 
    modern sleep technology. Our team of sleep researchers and sound designers crafted 
    devices that use soft ocean waves, dolphin calls, and guided breathing rhythms to 
    help users drift off naturally.</p>

    <p>We’re passionate about helping people improve their sleep in a way that 
    feels natural, relaxing, and sustainable. Dozephin isn’t just a product it’s a 
    nightly escape to your own personal beachside getaway.</p>
