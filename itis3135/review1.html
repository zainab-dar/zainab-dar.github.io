    <p>Overall, the page has all of the correct and necessary information and is formatted properly.</p>
    <p>There is one light background color and a dark font for the text.</p>
    <p>The links are not correctly formatted and they are still blue</p>
    <p><strong>CRAP</strong></p>
    <ul class="courses">
        <li><strong>Contrast:</strong> Contrast is pretty good, everything on the page is easy to read!</li>
        <li><strong>Repetition:</strong> Consistent use of formatting of bullet points, and links.</li>
        <li><strong>Alignment:</strong> The image should be center aligned as well as the caption. Everything else looks perfect. Great use of nested bullet points!</li>
        <li><strong>Proximity:</strong> All related content is grouped together and makes sense.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Header/Footer: The h1 of the page should be Tristan Meyers' Tedious Meerkat | [name of page]. I also recommend seperating the sections clearly to differentiate it from the rest of the page. The footer also has a repetition of a couple of the same links such as github.io and itis3135.</p>
    <p>The main section is good. All of the required information is present and it looks properly formatted.</p>
    <p>There is no accumulus validator.</p>
